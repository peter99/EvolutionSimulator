But if you have some background in biology and want to know what results you should expect, you have come to the right place. And if you are just a random person looking for random code, you have come to the randomly right place. Go on, try this piece of code.\r\n\r\n## Running the code #\r\nRunning of this code with custom number of generations to see has not been unabled. The software is under active development currently. Though a large part has been completed, a large part is still left.\r\n\r\n## Contributors #\r\nThis code has been majorly contributed by Peter Andrews (@the42guy) and Amol Grover (@flamingrush2).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
